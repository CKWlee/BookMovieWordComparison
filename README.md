# 📚🎬 Word Count Comparison: Books vs. Movie Scripts

**Summary:**  
This project explores how different genres vary in wordiness across two storytelling formats—books and movies. By analyzing the word counts of 25 novels and 25 movie scripts across genres like Comedy, Romance, Sci-Fi, and Horror, it reveals how the medium and genre shape narrative structure and length.

## 🔍 Project Overview

Using a Python script, this project:
- Processes books and movie scripts stored locally or accessed programmatically
- Computes and compares the **average word count per genre**
- Visualizes the results with bar charts using `matplotlib`

## 🎯 Goals

- Understand how genres like **Comedy**, **Romance**, **Sci-Fi**, and **Horror** differ in verbosity across books and films.
- Use word count as a proxy to analyze narrative density and structure.
- Explore how medium and format impact storytelling conventions.
